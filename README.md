Nivo Lightbox for WordPress
=============

A simple, flexible, responsive, retina-ready jQuery lightbox plugin. See http://dev7studios.com/nivo-lightbox for more info.

...built for WordPress! Out of the box, this will run on any link (`<a>`) that contains an image (`<img>`). It also groups WordPress galleries by default.

Want to customize it?

1. Run `npm install grunt --save-dev` in this directory to initialize grunt stuff.
1. Edit `nivo-lightbox-init.js`.
1. Run `grunt`.

Huzzah! `grunt image` is also available if you edit the images and have [ImageOptim-CLI](http://jamiemason.github.io/ImageOptim-CLI/) installed.
