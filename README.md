Nivo Lightbox for WordPress
=============

A simple, flexible, responsive, retina-ready jQuery lightbox plugin. See http://dev7studios.com/nivo-lightbox for more info.

...built for WordPress! Out of the box, this will run on any link (`<a>`) that contains an image (`<img>`). It also groups WordPress galleries by default.

Want to customize it?
=============

If you have [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed:

1. Run `npm install grunt --save-dev` in this directory to initialize grunt stuff.
1. Edit `nivo-lightbox-init.js`.
1. Run `grunt`.

Huzzah! If you don't have grunt installed:

1. Fork this repo.
1. Rework it for your workflow.

If you don't have grunt installed and don't know how to fork a repo:

1. I dunno. Be careful? This plugin isn't supported.

`grunt image` is also available if you edit the images and have [ImageOptim-CLI](http://jamiemason.github.io/ImageOptim-CLI/) installed.
